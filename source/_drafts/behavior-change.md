I left my PhD in the third year.
My research interest in the PhD was how to use robots to help people change their behavior, such as getting them to walk more regularly.
During this time, I read heavily into the psychology of behavior change.
I also talked with psychologists, observed rehabilitation sessions, and experimented on myself.
This post will explain my findings.

_tldr;_ Tiny habits are the way to go.

## Don't trust motivation

<!--
Well before beginning the PhD, I was a behavior change nerd.
(Probably, I was inspired by [Tim Ferriss and his interest in routines](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-ferriss-morning-routine-2017-1).)
I had been experimenting with forming new

### Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation

When I started the PhD, I was looking into how motivation could be used to help people change their motivation.
There are several different ways to motivate people.
We all know the "carrot" and "stick" approach, that is rewards and penalties.
In his book, _[Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://localhost:4000/blog/2021/01/11/behavior-change/)_, Daniel Pink makes a strong case that "carrot" and "stick" motivation doesn't work well.
One of the quickest ways to stop someone from enjoying something is to pay them to do it.

You might think that rewards might incentivize people to "work harder" and "get it done" better.
There is evidence that this works for drudgery, but anything creative, stronger incentives seem to do more harm than good.
Strong incentives make people focus on the incentive, making them worse at problem solving.

The "carrot" and "stick" way to motivate is called extrinsic motivation, or motivation from outside of us.
Pink speaks about the great potential of intrinsic motivation, motivation that comes from within.
To foster intrinsic motivation, he believes there are three key factors:
* Autonomy: our desire to direct our own lives
* Mastery:  the desire to get better at something worthwhile
* Purpose: the desire to do something in the service of something larger than ourselves

This is great and many companies are using this advice to keep their employees happy.
I just couldn't figure out how to have robot facilitate this.

### Behavioral economics

I also looked into behavioral economics.
To understand behavioral economics, you must first understand economics.
Economics assumes that people are completely rationally, like calculating robots.
In this model, more is always better and everyone takes advantage of the newest tax loopholes.

Behavioral economics doesn't believe that we're rational beings, at least not all the time.
Behavioral economics looks to understand where we are predictably irrational and, ideally, to make us all live better by structuring things in ways where our predictable irrationality benefits (or at least doesn't harm) us.
Some good examples of this include 
* Helping people save for retirement by making them have to opt out of saving, rather than opting in
* Helping people eat healthier by putting unhealthy options out of sight
* Reducing urinal spillage by putting a small fly sticker in the urinal

However, this too is hard to use to help shape people's behavior.
It often requires figuring out a structural way to vary the environment.
I didn't see many uses for robots here.

### Personality priorities

Next, I looked into how to personalize the feedback the robot would give participants.
I started by considering the work of Adler, which discriminates people based on their _Personality Priorities_.
